# Meet Postgres User Group Tallinn / Estonia

A short shout-out - as actually appeared to me that we've never done any advertising for the local [Estonian
Postgres User Group](https://www.meetup.com/Tallinn-PostgreSQL-Meetup/) at all, although we've been out there since 2017!

Thus, there might be a non-zero chance that someone who's in the vicinity, and into databases / Postgres, doesn't still
even know that we exist ðŸ™‚ Especially, as there's been very little regularity to the events after Covid ...

Anyways, excited to announce that the next event is happening on Wednesday ðŸ¥³! With 3 talks as usual - this time on:

* Patroni v4
* Running Postgres on Spot VMs
* Autovacuum
 
Even if you're tangentially interested / using PostgreSQL, we'd love to see you there! Always nice to network and
chat with fellow database enthusiasts, and learn a thing or two...

**Time**: Wednesday, 27th of November, 19.00

**Location**: Lift99, Tallinn

**Details**: [https://www.meetup.com/tallinn-postgresql-meetup/events/304323778/](https://www.meetup.com/tallinn-postgresql-meetup/events/304323778/)

And we of course also do welcome visitors from neighboring countries or even further. Finns ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡® especially - sailing
over the bay, have made it pretty international usually ðŸ™‚

And if you happen to dislike the Meetup.com platform, we also have a plain old mailing list, check out [pgug.ee](https://pgug.ee/)
for signing up and getting notified next time.

# A call for Guest Speakers from the region

The main struggle for us has usually been finding speakers - so that in a lot of cases me or Ants Aasma have had to pull
out something from our old "warchests"...but this of course gets kind of boring - instead, would be really nice to know how
companies in the region are doing, what are their pet peeves and wins with Postgres etc...so to keep our meetups diverse and
engaging, we're **always on the lookout for guest speakers from the region**. Whether you have a cool project to showcase,
a challenging issue you've recently solved, or a deep dive topic in mind, we'd love to hear from you! 

If you or someone you know might be interested, don't hesitate to reach out. We even have a small registration
[form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeypqwYeevnHHrjlhzzSqGRuAVjQvCWr0oMmj_44VSSAFjXNw/viewform)
out there, to make it easy to signal you interest - perfectly fine to have the talk on the idea level only yet.

See you next week!
