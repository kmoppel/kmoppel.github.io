# Meet Postgres User Group Tallinn / Estonia

Just a short shout-out to maybe get an extra attendee or two - as actually appeared that we've never done any advertising
for our local [Estonian Postgres User Group](https://www.meetup.com/Tallinn-PostgreSQL-Meetup/) on the Postgres feed at all - although we've been
out there since years and next week's event will be our 8th gathering!

Thus, there might actually be a non-zero chance that someone who's in the vicinity, and into databases / Postgres, doesn't
still even know that we exist ðŸ™‚ Especially, as events have been relatively few after Covid ...

Anyways, as mentioned - the next event is happening on Wednesday 27th ðŸ¥³! With 3 talks this time - and topics covering:

* Patroni v4
* Running Postgres on Spot VMs
* An Autovacuum war-story

Even if tangentially interested / using PostgreSQL, we'd love to see you there! Always nice to network and
chat with fellow database enthusiasts, and hopefully learn a thing or two as well...

**Time**: Wednesday, 27th of November, 19.00

**Location**: Lift99, Tallinn

**Details**: [https://www.meetup.com/tallinn-postgresql-meetup/events/304323778/](https://www.meetup.com/tallinn-postgresql-meetup/events/304323778/)

And we of course also do welcome visitors from neighboring countries or even further. Finns ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡® especially - sailing
over the bay, have made it pretty international usually ðŸ™‚

And if you happen to dislike the Meetup.com platform, we also have a plain old mailing list, check out [pgug.ee](https://pgug.ee/)
for signing up and getting notified next time.

# A call for Guest Speakers from the region

The main struggle for our group sadly has been finding speakers (as speaking out publicly is not the main trait of Nordic
people seems) - so that in a lot of cases me or Ants Aasma have had to pull
out something from our old warchests...but this of course gets kind of boring - instead, would be really nice to know how
companies in the region are doing, what are their pet peeves and wins with Postgres etc. Thus to keep our meetups diverse and
engaging, we're **always on the lookout for guest speakers from the region**! So whether you have a cool project to showcase,
a challenging issue you've recently solved, or a deep dive topic in mind, we'd love to hear from you! 

If you or someone you know might be interested, don't hesitate to reach out. We even have a small registration
[form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeypqwYeevnHHrjlhzzSqGRuAVjQvCWr0oMmj_44VSSAFjXNw/viewform)
, to make it easy to signal your interest - perfectly fine to have the talk only on the idea level yet also.

See you next week!
