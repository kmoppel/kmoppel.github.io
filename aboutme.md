A database and Postgres specialist.

Iâ€™ve put in my 20K+ hours with many Postgres-heavy businesses in Europe, like Zalando, BMW, Klarna, Cognite - and thus have developed
a pretty good gut feeling of what works reasonably well for some purpose and what not.

Occasional speaker at conferences, co-founder of [Estonian Postgres User Group](https://www.meetup.com/tallinn-postgresql-meetup/).
An [interview](https://postgresql.life/post/kaarel_moppel/) with me on [postgresql.life](https://postgresql.life/) from some years ago.
